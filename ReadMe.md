  This is a course project in EE380L Data Mining conducted by Edison Thomaz (ethomaz@utexas.edu). More course information could be view on http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~ethomaz/courses/dm/sp2020.html.
  
  Together, we used different ways to explore the Extrasensory Dataset for behavioral context recognition in-the-wild from mobile sensors.(http://extrasensory.ucsd.edu/)
